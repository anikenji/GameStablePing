/// used to produce, so everything downstream - licence token, set-token, profile sync - is untouched.

/// Two things make it worth doing. The app never sees the password, which matters for software
/// that installs a network driver and asks for administrator rights. And the device-limit
/// refusal moves onto a web page that can explain it, instead of a native dialog shown after
